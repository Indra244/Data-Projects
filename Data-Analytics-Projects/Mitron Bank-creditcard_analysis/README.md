#Problem Statement:

#Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market. So, they need a data analyst team to help them find insights from their customers data which will help them in launching the new credit cards.
#However, the strategy director of Mitron Bank is skeptical and asked them to do a pilot project with the sample data before handing over them the full project.
#We have to analyse the provided sample data and report key findings to the strategy team of Mitron Bank. This analysis is expected to guide them in tailoring the credit cards to customer needs and market trends.
